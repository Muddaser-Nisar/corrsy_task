# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: clone the project

git clone https://github.com/Muddaser-Nisar/corrsy_task

## Step 2: install node_modules

cd corssy(project directory)
then npm i or yarn add


### For Android

npx react-native run-android

### For iOS

cd ios
then npx react-native run-ios

### Screenshot of the app

### The total amount of time spent on this assessment

I've spent a complete one working day efforts on this task

### Technical choices I made while implementing this app


### I've implemented each and everything from the scracth and my fain focus was to write upto max clean,resuable code while practing the latest practices 

### SOLID Architecture

Adopted the SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion) to ensure a modular and flexible architecture. This approach facilitates easier collaboration among developers and makes the codebase more adaptable to future changes.

### Responsive Design

Incorporated a responsive design approach using a responsive library to ensure the application's user interface (UI) adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes and orientations. This enhances user experience and accessibility across different devices.

### Redux Toolkit

Utilized Redux Toolkit, a powerful library for Redux state management, to streamline state updates, manage complex application states efficiently, and handle asynchronous API calls seamlessly. Redux Toolkit's simplified syntax and 
built-in tools enhance developer productivity and code maintainability.

### Robust State Management

Emphasized writing robust and scalable code for state management, ensuring the application maintains consistent and reliable states across different components and user interactions. This approach minimizes bugs, enhances stability, and improves overall performance.

### Mock Authentication

Implemented a comprehensive mock authentication flow to simulate real-world authentication processes during development and testing phases. This enables thorough validation of authentication-related features without relying on external authentication services or risking sensitive data exposure.

### Interactive UI Design

Designed an intuitive and interactive user interface (UI) with engaging elements and smooth transitions to provide users with an immersive and enjoyable experience. Interactive UI components enhance user engagement, encourage exploration, and make the application more appealing.

### Secure Base URL

Ensured security by configuring the base URL for API endpoints using environment variables. This practice protects sensitive information, such as API keys or authentication tokens, from exposure in the application's source code, reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities.

### SVG Icons

Employed scalable vector graphics (SVG) for iconography to achieve crisp and high-quality visuals across different screen resolutions and pixel densities. SVG icons offer flexibility, maintain sharpness, and consume fewer resources compared to raster images, enhancing performance and user experience.
These technical choices were made to create a robust, scalable, and user-centric application, prioritizing factors such as security, maintainability, performance, and user satisfaction.

### If I have more time or next phase

### 1-CI/CD pipelines could be implemented
### 3-Splash screen could be implemented
### 4-Internet connectivity across the app
### 5-App ICONS
### 6-Error Boundaries
### 7-Store(app store and play store) Configuration
### 8-Animation/UI enhancement
### 9-Sonar Quebe (for code quality)

### Assumtions I made

### 1-I donâ€™t find any mapping key b/w chapters and lessons so treated/assumed chapter as single entity for time being
### 2- For quiz I've implemented mock up quiz
### 3-For Progress i've implemented the logic but due to short time I couldn't render it


###  I hope efforts will be appreciated.Thank you!!!
